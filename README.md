Math-Thesis
========
"A Classification of Chaos for Linear Fractional Transformations of the Backward Shift in lp," my undergraduate Mathematics thesis.  No code here, just some really cool mathematics.  Final document is "FinalDoc.pdf"

Chapters
--------
The math starts getting pretty interesting and complex (that's a pun) in the 4th chapter.

- Introduction
- Preliminaries
- Analytic Functions and Conformal Mappings
- Banach and lp spaces
- Chaos
- Main Results
