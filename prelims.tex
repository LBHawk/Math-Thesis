The purpose of this section of the paper is to review and expand on some of the more basic mathematical topics which are important in \authorsetals paper.  We review topics in metric spaces, complex analysis, and a few things from linear algebra.  These topics are the basic building blocks we need to understand some of the more advanced concepts in the paper.
